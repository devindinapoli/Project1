### Objective - 

Our app uses the Yummly api to search their recipe database. Search options are by dish, desired ingredients, and/or ingredients to exclude.  Advanced search options include cuisine, diet, and cooking time.

After results are returned, there is an option to favorite recipes.  When the user favorites a recipe, a 'show favorites' button will appear.

Google maps API is used to provide the user with nearby grocery stores where they can purchase the indgredients for their dish.

### UI -

Materialize and some vanilla CSS

### Database -

Firebase is used to store user searches and favorites.
